          Lunchtime Labs is a small-but-mighty boutique software development
          shop based in NYC.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are inspired by elegant design in technology--by the idea that,
          regardless of how technically sophisticated an app is underneath, it
          should be effortless to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an age of clickbait, internet addiction and compulsive phone use,
          we aim to build apps that set people free and bring them closer to
          their souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an age where more generations of people find themselves estranged
          and confused by technology, we aim to build apps that are simple and
          inclusive.
        </p>
        <p class="editable">
          Our specialists have years of experience developing state-of-the-art
          native, web, mobile and desktop apps. We love taking projects from
          the ideation stage through product design, user testing, into launch
          and beyond.

        <h3>Partywirks</h3>
        <p>
          We took Partywirks from their aging "Web 1.0" setup, to a
          state-of-the art web app.
        </p>
        <p>
          We travelled to Mexico to perform a product-design sprint with the
          PartyWirks team, so we could ensure that we were solving the right
          problem and had input and buy in from the business, sales, and
          marketing experts on their staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          We took Partywirks through ideation, prototyping, design, development,
          and ultimately to a successful launch of their groundbreaking new
          booking platform.
        </p>

        <h3>OnTrack Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          We totally rebuilt and modernized then OnTrack Diabetes glucose
          monitoring platform, creating beautiful native apps for both Android
          and iOs platforms.
